Abstract
========
This study presents a comprehensive exploration of Frederickson's algorithm, a cornerstone in the field of distributed computing, particularly focusing on its implementation within a distributed network using AHCv2 library. Frederickson's algorithm is renowned for its innovative approach to solving problems related to dynamic graphs, such as maintaining the minimum spanning tree (MST) in a network that undergoes frequent updates. The primary objective of this research is to implement Frederickson's algorithm in a simulated distributed network environment, thereby evaluating its efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in real-world scenarios.
