This study presents a comprehensive exploration of Frederickson's algorithm, a cornerstone in the field of distributed computing, particularly focusing on its implementation within a distributed network using AHCv2 library. Frederickson's algorithm is renowned for its innovative approach to solving problems related to dynamic graphs, such as maintaining the minimum spanning tree (MST) in a network that undergoes frequent updates. The primary objective of this research is to implement Frederickson's algorithm in a simulated distributed network environment, thereby evaluating its efficiency, scalability, and adaptability in real-world scenarios. The primary goal of this distributed algorithm is to find the MST of the given network graph. It is suitable for network updates such as adding new network to the system or deleting a node from it. Finding the MST is important because if a node knows how to send its message to an another node with a minnumum travel time it will be the best solution. You can always use multicast or broadcast messaging types but it will some times bottleneks the network and not efficent way to communicate point of view of power and messaging complexity.
